## Original tasks:

In this repository, you'll find an app that uses content from the array of posts in [libs/articles](task2/src/libs/articles.js). It's currently all in one component.

ðŸ‘‰ Use component-based thinking to break the code in the `App` component into separate components. Use draw.io's VS Code integration (or an image from another diagramming software) to diagram out your components and their states and props and include your diagram in this repo before refactoring the code.

ðŸ‘‰ Style the components you've just made using **CSS modules**.

ðŸ‘‰ Use the **component library** of your choice to replace one or more of the existing components and/or add one or more new components to the application.

ðŸ‘‰ Use Auth0 to add simple **authentication** to your app so that users must be logged in to view the articles.

ðŸ‘‰ **Deploy** your front end application, and include the URL in the readme.

ðŸ‘‰ Create **documentation** for your app, and refactor this readme with your documentation. You can use a tool like [readme.so](https://readme.so/editor).

### ðŸŒŸ Bonus tasks

If you finish the tasks above and want to keep exploring and practicing, keep coding! Feel free to work on a personal project or explore something you're curious about.

If you'd like to carry on with this repo, here are some ideas:

- Create additional features for your app.
- Use **Storybook** to document your UI components.
- Explore what else you can do with Auth0 to add additional auth to your blog (such as roles).
- Add test files and tests for your components.
- Create and deploy a REST API back end to serve your articles.
